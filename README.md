# Multilingual Bridge

A WordPress plugin that bridges the gap between WPML and the WordPress REST API, providing comprehensive multilingual support for modern WordPress applications.

## Overview

Multilingual Bridge enhances WPML's functionality by adding full REST API support for multilingual content. It solves common challenges developers face when building headless WordPress applications or integrating with external systems that need language-aware content.

## Problems This Plugin Solves

- **No Native WPML REST API Support**: WPML doesn't provide built-in REST API integration
- **Complex Language Queries**: Filtering posts by language in REST API requires custom implementation
- **Missing Translation Links**: No easy way to discover content translations via REST API
- **Cumbersome WPML API**: Simplifies complex WPML operations with helper functions
- **Term Relationship Bugs**: Works around WPML bugs when deleting term relationships across languages

## Key Features

### üåê REST API Language Support
- Automatically adds `language_code` field to all REST API responses
- Includes translation links in the `_links` property with full embed support
- Support for all post types with REST API enabled

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer-Friendly Helpers
- Simplified functions for common WPML operations
- Get post language with a single function call
- Retrieve all translations of a post easily
- Check translation completeness
- Safely delete term relationships across languages

### üöÄ Modern Development
- Full support for headless WordPress architectures
- Compatible with JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js)
- Type-safe with PHPStan level 5
- WordPress coding standards compliant

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- WPML plugin installed and activated
- PHP 8.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the releases page
2. Upload to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

4. Ensure WPML is installed and activated

## Quick Start

### REST API Examples

#### Response includes language information and translation links:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "Hello World",
  "language_code": "en",
  "_links": {
    "translations": [
      {
        "href": "https://site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/456",
        "wpml_language": "de",
        "title": "Translation: German",
        "embeddable": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### PHP Helper Examples

```php
use Multilingual_Bridge\Helpers\WPML_Post_Helper;

// Get post language
$language = WPML_Post_Helper::get_language($post_id);

// Get all translations
$translations = WPML_Post_Helper::get_language_versions($post_id);

// Check if post has all translations
if (WPML_Post_Helper::has_all_translations($post_id)) {
    echo "Fully translated!";
}

// Safely delete term relationships
WPML_Post_Helper::safe_delete_term_relationships($post_id, 'category');
```
