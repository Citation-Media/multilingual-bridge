Bridges the gap between WPML and WordPress REST API, adding comprehensive multilingual support for modern WordPress applications.

== Description ==

Multilingual Bridge enhances WPML's functionality by adding full REST API support for multilingual content. Perfect for headless WordPress, mobile apps, and external integrations that need language-aware content.

**Key Problems Solved:**

* WPML has no native REST API support
* No easy way to filter posts by language in REST API
* Complex WPML API calls simplified
* Missing translation information in REST responses
* WPML bugs when deleting term relationships

**Main Features:**

* **Automatic Language Fields** - Adds `language_code` to all REST API responses
* **Translation Links** - Discover all translations via `_links.translation`
* **Language Filtering** - Query posts by language with `?lang=` parameter
* **Developer Helpers** - Simplified functions for common WPML operations
* **Bug Workarounds** - Safely handle term relationships across languages
* **Language Debug Tool** - Admin tool to manage posts in unconfigured languages

**REST API Examples:**

Get German posts:
`GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?lang=de`

Get all posts (all languages):
`GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?lang=all`

**Perfect for:**

* Headless WordPress with Next.js, Gatsby, or Nuxt
* Mobile app development
* External system integrations
* Custom admin interfaces
* Multilingual content migrations

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate WPML (required)
2. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/multilang-bridge`
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Start using the enhanced REST API endpoints

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require WPML? =

Yes, WPML must be installed and activated. This plugin extends WPML's functionality to work with the REST API.

= Which post types are supported? =

All post types that have REST API support enabled will automatically get language fields and filtering capabilities.

= Can I filter custom post types by language? =

Yes! Any custom post type with `show_in_rest => true` will support language filtering.

= How do I get all translations of a post? =

The plugin automatically adds translation links to the `_links` property of each REST response. You can also use the helper functions in PHP.

= Does it work with custom taxonomies? =

Yes, the helper functions support all taxonomies, including custom ones.

= Is it compatible with Gutenberg? =

Yes, the plugin is fully compatible with the block editor and enhances its REST API endpoints.

= How do I clean up posts in deactivated languages? =

Use the Language Debug tool under Tools â†’ Language Debug in your WordPress admin. It can find and manage posts in languages that are no longer active in WPML.
